**Statistical Learning Theory: Coding Exercises**
This repository collects the code written by students for the SLT coding exercises.

In order to add your code for a particular exercise, e.g. *1_locally_linear_embedding* :

(1) First you need to request and get access to the repository.

(2) Clone the repository to your machine, i.e.

    git clone https://gitlab.vis.ethz.ch/vwegmayr/slt-coding-exercises.git
    
(3) Create a new branch for yourself, i.e.

    git branch your-legi-number
    
(5) Create a brunch for the exercise, i.e.

    git checkout -b 1_locally_linear_embedding your-legi-number
