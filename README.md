# Statistical Learning Theory: Coding Exercises #

This repository collects the code written by students for the SLT coding exercises.


## Initial setup ##

(1) First you need to request and get access to the repository.

(2) Clone the repository to your machine, i.e.
```git clone https://gitlab.vis.ethz.ch/vwegmayr/slt-coding-exercises.git```

    ```git clone https://gitlab.vis.ethz.ch/vwegmayr/slt-coding-exercises.git```
    
(3) Change into the repository directory:
    
    cd slt-coding-exercises
    
(4) Create a branch for yourself, from where all your exercises are derived later:

    git branch your-legi-number
    


## Adding code ##

In order to add your code for a particular exercise, e.g. *1_locally_linear_embedding* :

(1) Change into the repository directory:
    
    cd slt-coding-exercises
    
(2) Switch to your branch:

    git checkout your-legi-number
    
(4) Create a branch for the exercise, i.e.

    git checkout -b your-legi-number/1_locally_linear_embedding
    
(5) Do some work

(6) Eventually push your files, i.e.

    git push --set-upstream origin your-legi-number/1_locally_linear_embedding
