**Statistical Learning Theory: Coding Exercises**
This repository collects the code written by students for the SLT coding exercises.

In order to add your code for a particular exercise, e.g. *1_locally_linear_embedding* :

If this is the first time you add code:

(1) First you need to request and get access to the repository.

(2) Clone the repository to your machine, i.e.

    git clone https://gitlab.vis.ethz.ch/vwegmayr/slt-coding-exercises.git
    
(3) Change into the repository directory:
    
    cd slt-coding-exercises
    
(4) Create a branch for the exercise, i.e.

    git checkout -b your-legi-number/1_locally_linear_embedding
    
(5) Do some work

(6) Eventually push your files, i.e.

    git push --set-upstream origin your-legi-number/1_locally_linear_embedding
    
If you have already done steps (1)+(2), then you only need to redo (3)-(6) and replace *1_locally_linear_embedding* with the appropriate exercise name.
